# Mastermind Game README

## Description
This project implements a simple Mastermind game where a client guesses a secret combination generated by the server. The server provides feedback to the client after each guess, indicating the number of correct and incorrect positions. The game continues until the correct combination is guessed.

## How to Play
1. **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    javac Server.java
    java Server
    ```

2. **Run the Client:**
    ```bash
    javac Client.java
    java Client
    ```

3. The server generates a secret combination of four letters (B, G, O, R, W, Y).
4. The client receives a message to start guessing the combination.
5. Enter your guess when prompted by the client.
6. The server provides feedback on the correctness of the guess.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the correct combination is guessed.
8. The game ends, and the server prints the number of attempts taken to guess the correct combination.

## Files
- `Client.java`: Contains the client-side code for connecting to the server, reading input, and sending guesses.
- `Server.java`: Implements the server-side logic, generates a random combination, and provides feedback to the client.

## Gameplay
- The client inputs guesses, and the server responds with feedback.
- The game continues until the correct combination is guessed.
- The number of attempts is displayed when the correct combination is found.

## Notes
- The default port for communication is 1234, but you can modify it in both `Client` and `Server` classes if needed.
- Make sure to have Java installed on your system to run the game.

Have fun playing Mastermind! Trouvez la combinaison correcte et amusez-vous bien!
